README for Net::SMPP Perl module
================================
12.3.2001, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@iki.fi>

This readme is describes version 0.01 of the module.

Net::SMPP is an implementation of Short Message Peer to Peer protocol over
TCP/IP. This protocol is frequently used in the telecoms and mobile
operator world to pass short messages between systems that implement
the short message service (SMS). It is applicable to both european GSM
and american CDMA based systems. The SMPP protocol is documented at

	www.smpp.org

This module aims at fully implementing version 3.4 of the
protocol. During the 0.xx version series the implementation will still
be incomplete or may contain parts that are implemented but never
tested. Read comments in the source to see if testing has been
done. If you test a previusly untested PDU (protocol data unit),
please report success, failure, or difficulties to the author.
